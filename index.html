                <h1>What Is a Facebook Profile?</h1>
                <p>Think of a Facebook profile as your personal page as an individual. You actually can't use any other Facebook feature without signing up for a profile first. Facebook profile page Your profile is a place where you can put information about
                    yourself (your name, profile photo, short bio, where you went to school, where you work, what your favorite books are, and so on). It’s also a place to post your status to express what you are doing, thinking, feeling, etc. Some of
                    the ways you can personalize your profile include: Using a fun cover photo or profile picture Writing a snappy bio Uploading photo albums Displaying your workplace Adding in your alma mater(s) Displaying your hometown Adding your family
                    members Updating your marital status Letting others know what you’re looking for: Friendship, Networking, Men, Women The more you can add to your Facebook profile, the more others will feel they have a sense of who you are. Remember,
                    Facebook profiles are meant to be a representation of you as an individual. You can connect with others through your profile by adding them as friends (or optionally having them follow you if you have this enabled). You also have full
                    control over your privacy, so you get to choose what kind of information you want to share with the public, with your friends, and even with custom lists of friends.</p>

                <h1>What Is a Facebook Page?</h1>
                <p>A Facebook Page is very similar to a Facebook profile, but it's always public. Pages are typically used to represent public figures, businesses, brands, organizations, and other entities. Facebook Page profile Facebook Pages have similar
                    layouts and main features to Facebook profiles, such as a cover photo, main photo, photo albums, status updates, and more. These are all ways that public figures, brands, businesses, and other entities can interact with their audience

                    features to profiles and pages, including a cover photo, a feed of updates, and more. Anybody who creates a group can decide whether to make the group public for anyone to join, require admin approval for members to join, or make a
                    group private by invitation only. Groups also include features like: Member invitations Real-time chats File uploads Pinned announcements A search function Like pages, groups can be managed by multiple users as admins or moderators.
                    These users accept and reject member requests, pin announcements to the top of the feed, remove members who don't follow the group rules, and more. Admins can appoint particularly knowledgeable group members as Group Experts who can
